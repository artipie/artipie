# Artipie REST API

One objective of Artipie is to provide APIs that are compatible with Artifactory APIs so that customers can have an easy and smooth transition from Artifactory to Artipie if they choose to.  The set of APIs are to manage repositories, users, repository permissions and more.

## Create Repository

Creates new docker repository with `default` storage alias and provided name.

> **PUT** /api/repositories/{repoKey}

Consumes json with the following fields (any other fields are ignored): 

Field name | Type | Meaning | Required
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ---------
key | string | New repository name | Y
rclass | string | Repository class, only `local` type is supported | Y
packageType | string | Artifact type, only `docker` type is supported | Y
dockerApiVersion | string | Docker API version, we only support `V2` | Y

Possible responses:
- `200 OK` when new repository was successfully created
- `400 BAD REQUEST` in the cases when repository with such name already exists or invalid json was sent
- `500 INTERNAL ERROR` in the case of unexpected server error

Artifactory documentation can be found [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/rtf/artifactory+rest+api#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-CreateRepository). 

## Users

### Get Users

    "realm" : "Internal"
  }, {
    "name": "danl",
    "uri" : "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/security/users/danl",

```
Where `name` field contains user name, `uri` - URI to obtain user details, user `realm` is always `Internal`.

### Get Permission Targets

Endpoint to obtain the permission targets [list](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/rtf/artifactory+rest+api#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetPermissionTargets). 
From the Artipie point of view permission target is a repository, so basically this endpoint returns list of the 
existing repositories. 

> **GET**  /api/security/permissions

Returns json array of the following form:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "readSourceArtifacts",
    "uri" : "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/security/permissions/readSourceArtifacts"
  }, {
    "name": "populateCaches",
    "uri" : "http://localhost:8081/artifactory/api/security/permissions/populateCaches"
  }
]
```
Where `name` is a permission target name and `uri` - URI to obtain permission target details.

### Get Permission Target Details

Endpoint to get the [details](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/rtf/artifactory+rest+api#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-GetPermissionTargetDetails) 
of a Permission Target, or, if other words, Artipie repository permissions details.

> **GET** /api/security/permissions/{permissionTargetName}

Returns json of the following format:

```json
{
  "repositories": ["{permissionTargetName}"],
  "principals": {
    "users" : {

principals | json object | Repository permissions details, contains `users` element with user permission details | Y

The set of supported permissions along with the shortening convention:

```text
w=deploy; m=admin; r=read; d=delete (`delete` is supported for file storage only)
```

If requested `{permissionTargetName}` does not exist, `404 NOT FOUND` status is returned.

### Create or Replace Permission Target
