      # @todo #851:30min Fix integration tests. Integration tests should start Artipie docker
      #  image built on package state (artipie/artipie:1.0-SNAPSHOT) using testcontainers,
      #  and test it against different use cases. Update integration tests and enable
      #  CI instruction below to run it on each push and PR. So we need some replacement for
      #  `ArtipieServer` class to use it in integration tests.
