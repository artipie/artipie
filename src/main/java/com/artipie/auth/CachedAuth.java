 *  Instead of using scheduled executor to clean-up all cache map, use
 *  some configuration to clean-up only expired items, e.g. if token was not accessed for
 *  X minutes, then remove only this token. Consider using Guava's time-evicted-cache
 *  implementation: https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained#eviction
 * @todo #442:30min Refactor this class to move cache field to instance field
 *  and make sure the instance is not created on each request. Right now we're using
 *  a hotfix - CachedAuth created from settings on each request but uses static hash map
 *  field for caching.
