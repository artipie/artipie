## Metrics

// @todo #1031:30min Verify this configuration section: start Artipie locally, configure metrics (try 
//  each type) and check how they work. Check `com.artipie.metrics` package for all details. When checking,
//  extend this documentation with examples and details about gathered statistics.

Artipie metrics are meant to gather incoming HTTP requests statistic and publish it in the 
configured format: it can be application log, [`Prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/) or data storage.

### Logging metrics

To enable some basic metrics collecting and periodic publishing to application log
add `metrics` to `meta` section of global configuration file `/etc/artipie/artipie.yml`:

```yaml
meta:
  metrics:
    type: log # Metrics type, `log` to print statistics into application log
    interval: 5 # Publishing interval in seconds, default value is 5
```

### Storage metrics

Storage metrics will periodically publish statistics to [storage](./Configuration-Storage.md) as text files, 
here is the way to configure such metrics:
```yaml
meta:
  metrics:
    type: asto # Metrics type, `asto` to publish statistics into storage
    storage: # Storage to publish the metrics to
      type: fs
      path: /tmp/artipie/statistict
```

Storage metrics can be obtained via HTTP `GET` request by path `http://{host}:{port}/.metrics`, 
where `{host}` and `{port}` Artipie service host and port accordingly. The response is a json object
with gathered statistics.

### Prometheus metrics

To collect metrics via [`Prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/), simply configure `metrics` like this:

```yaml
meta :
  metrics :
    type : prometheus
```
Metrics in Prometheus compatible format will be available on `http://{host}:{port}/prometheus/metrics` path,
where `{host}` and `{port}` Artipie service host and port.
