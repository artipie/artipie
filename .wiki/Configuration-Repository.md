# Repository configuration

Artipie repository configuration is a yaml file, where repository type and artifacts storage are required
to be specified:
```yaml
repo:
  type: maven
  storage: 
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data
  permissions:
    alice:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```
`type` specifies the type of the repository (all supported types are listed below) and `storage` 
[configures](./Configuration-Storage.md) a storage to store repository data. [Permissions section](./Configuration-Repository Permissions.md)
allows to provide upload or download access for users and groups. 

> **Warning**
> Name of the repository configuration file is the name of the repository.

For now Artipie supports the following repository types:

| Type  | Description   |
|---|---|
| [Files](./Configuration-Repository.md#file) | General purpose files repository |
| [Files Proxy](./Configuration-Repository.md#file-proxy-mirror) | Files repository proxy |
| [Maven](./Configuration-Repository.md#maven) | [Java artifacts and dependencies repository](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) |
| [Maven Proxy](./Configuration-Repository.md#maven-proxy) | Proxy for maven repository |
| [Rpm](./Configuration-Repository.md#rpm) | `.rpm` ([linux binaries](https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/)) packages repository |
| [Docker](./Configuration-Repository.md#docker) | [Docker images registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) |
| [Docker Proxy](./Configuration-Repository.md#docker-proxy) | Proxy for docker repository |
| [Helm](./Configuration-Repository.md#helm) | [Helm charts repository](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/) |
| [Npm](./Configuration-Repository.md#npm) | [JavaScript code sharing and packages store](https://www.npmjs.com/) |
| [Npm Proxy](./Configuration-Repository.md#npm-proxy) | Proxy for NPM repository |

| [Debian](./Configuration-Repository.md#debian) | [Debian linux packages repository](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format) |
| [Conda](./Configuration-Repository.md#conda) | [Built packages for data science](https://www.anaconda.com/) |

Detailed configuration for each repository is provided in the corresponding subsection below.

## Single repository on port

Artipie repositories may run on separate ports if configured.
This feature may be especially useful for Docker repository,
as it's API is not well suited to serve multiple repositories on single port.

To run repository on its own port
`port` parameter should be specified in repository configuration YAML as follows:

```yaml
repo:
  type: <repository type>
  port: 54321
  ...
```

> **Warning**
> Artipie scans repositories for port configuration only on start, 
> so server requires restart in order to apply changes made in runtime.

## File

Files repository is a general purpose file storage which provides API for upload and download: `PUT` requests for upload and `GET` for download.
To set up this repository, create config with `file` repository type and storage configuration. [Permissions configuration](./Configuration-Repository Permissions.md) 
can authorize users allowed to upload and download.

*Example:*
```yaml
repo:
  type: file
  storage: default
  permissions:
    alice:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```

In order to upload a binary file to the storage, send a `PUT` HTTP request with file contents:

```bash
echo "hello world" > test.txt
curl -X PUT --data-binary "@test.txt" http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}/test.txt
```

In order to download a file, send a `GET` HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X GET http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}/text.txt
```

In the examples above `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}` 
is the name of files repository.

## File proxy (mirror)

File proxy or mirror is a general purpose files mirror. It acts like a transparent HTTP proxy for one host
and caches all the data locally. To configure it use `file-proxy` repository type with required `remotes` section which should include
one remote configuration. Each remote config must provide `url` for remote file server and optional `username` and `password` for authentication.
Proxy is a read-only repository, nobody can upload to it. Only `download` permissions make sense here. Storage can be configured for
caching capabilities.

*Example:*
```yaml
repo:
  type: file-proxy
  storage: default
  remotes:
    - url: "https://remote-server.com"
      username: "alice" # optional username
      password: "qwerty" # optional password
      storage: # optional storage to cache proxy data
        type: fs
        path: tmp/files-proxy/data
  permissions:
    "*":
      - download
```

In order to download a file, send a `GET` HTTP request:

```bash
curl -X GET http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}/test.txt
```
were `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}`
is the name of repository. Files proxy repository will proxy the request to remote, cache data in 
storage (if configured) and return the result.

## Maven

To host a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) repository for Java artifacts and dependencies try the
following configuration:

```yaml
repo:
  type: maven
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data
  permissions:
    alice:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```

To use this repository as regular maven repository in Java project, add the following configuration 
into `pom` project file (alternatively [configure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html)
it via [`~/.m2/settings.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html)):

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>{artipie-server-id}</id>
        <url>http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
Then run `mvn install` (or `mvn install -U` to force download dependencies).

To deploy the project into Artipie repository, add [`<distributionManagement>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Distribution_Management)
section to [`pom.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)
project file (don't forget to specify authentication credentials in
[`~/.m2/settings.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers)
for `artipie` server):

```xml
<project>
  [...]
  <distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <url>http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
    <repository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <url>http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
</project>
```
In the examples above `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}`
is the name of maven repository.

## Maven proxy

Maven proxy repository will redirect all the requests to the remotes. Repository configuration allows
to specify several remotes, Artipie will try to obtain the artifact from the remotes list one by one
while the artifact is not found. If caching is enabled, previously downloaded packages will be 
available when source repository is down:

```yaml
repo:
  type: maven-proxy
  remotes:
    - url: https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2
      username: Aladdin # optional
      password: OpenSesame # optional
      cache: # optional
        storage:
          type: fs
          path: /tmp/artipie/maven-central-cache
    - url: https://maven.example.com/
  permissions:
    "*":
      - download
```
Only `download` permissions make sense here.

To use this repository as regular maven repository in Java project, add the following configuration
into `pom` project file (alternatively [configure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html)
it via [`~/.m2/settings.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html)):

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>{artipie-server-id}</id>
        <url>http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
where `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}`
is the name of maven repository.

## RPM

Rpm repository is a linux binary packages repository, which [`yum`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yum_%28software%29) 
and [`dnf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_%28software%29) can understand. Try the following 
configuration to add rpm repository:

```yaml
repo:
  type: rpm
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/centos
  settings:
    digest: sha256 # packages digest algorithm
    naming-policy: sha1 # naming policy for metadata files
    filelists: true # is filelist metadata file required
    # repository update mode:
    update:
      # update metadata on package upload
      on: upload
      # or schedule the update
      on:
       cron: 0 2 * * *
  permissions:
    alice:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```
Section `setting` allows to configure repository-specific parameters and is not required:
- `digest` - digest algorithm for rpm packages checksum calculation, sha256 (default) and sha1 are supported
- `naming-policy` - naming policy for metadata files: plain, sha1 or sha256 (default) prefixed
- `filelists` - Calculate metadata `filelists.xml`, true by default
- `update` section allows to set update mode: either update the repository when the package is uploaded via HTTP 
or schedule the update via cron

[Permissions configuration](./Configuration-Repository Permissions.md) section specifies users who can upload and download from the repository.

In order to use Artipie `rpm` repository with `yum` follow the steps:

- Install `yum-utils` if needed: `yum install yum-utils`
- Add Artipie repository: `yum-config-manager --add-repo=http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}` where `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}`
  is the name of `rpm` repository
- Refresh the local repository: `yum upgrade all`
- Install the packages: `yum install package-name`

No `yum` nether `dnf` support packages upload, but you can upload `rpm` file into Artipie `rpm` 
repository with HTTP `PUT` request:
```commandline
curl -X PUT --data-binary "@my-pkg.rpm" http://{host}:{port}/{repository-name}/my-pkg.rpm?override=true&skip_update=true
```

The request supports the following parameters:
- `override` allows to override existing `rpm` file in the repository, not required, false by default
- `skip_update` can be used to skip repository metadata update, not required, false by default. 
In update mode `cron` this parameter is ignored (as repository metadata are updated by schedule).
