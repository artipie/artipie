## Docker

[Docker registry is server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images.](https://docs.docker.com/registry/#what-it-is)
Try the following configuration to use Artipie Docker Repository:

```yaml
repo:
  type: docker
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/data
  permissions:
    alice:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```
Note, that Docker repository also supports [granular permissions](../Configuration-Repository-Permissions.md#docker-repository-granular-permissions).

### Usage example

In order to push Docker image into Artipie repository, let's pull an existing one from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```
Since the Docker registry is going to be located at {host}:{port}/{repository-name}, let's tag
the pulled image respectively:
```bash
docker image tag ubuntu {host}:{port}/{repository-name}/myubuntuimage
```
Then, let's log in into Artipie Docker registry:
```bash
docker login --username {username} --password {password} {host}:{port}
```
And finally, push the pulled image:
```bash
docker push {host}:{port}/{repository-name}/myubuntuimage
```
The image can be pulled as well (first, remove it from local registry as it was downloaded and tagged before):
```bash
docker image rm {host}:{port}/{repository-name}/myubuntuimage
docker pull {host}:{port}/{repository-name}/myubuntuimage
```

### Advanced options

#### Docker on port

Assign a port for the repository to access the image by name without using `{repository-name}` prefix.
To do that we add `port` parameter into repository settings `yaml`:

```yaml
repo:
  port: 5463
  type: docker
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/data
```

Now we may pull image `{host}:{port}/{repository-name}/myubuntuimage` we pushed before as `{host}:5463/myubuntuimage`:

```bash
docker pull {host}:5463/myubuntuimage
```

In the examples above `{host}` and `{port}` are Artipie service host and port, `{repository-name}`
is the name of Docker repository.
