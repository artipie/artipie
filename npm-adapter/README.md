This Java library turns your binary storage (files, S3 objects, anything) into NPM repository,
which provides functionality for JavaScript code sharing and packages store. You may add it to your 
binary storage and it will become a fully-functionable NPM repository, which `npm` client will 
perfectly understand.

If you have any question or suggestions, do not hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/artipie/artipie/issues/new) or contact us in

This is the dependency you need:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.artipie</groupId>
  <artifactId>npm-adapter</artifactId>
  <version>[...]</version>
</dependency>
```

## How it works?

First, you upload a json file generated by `npm publish`. Then,
you call `Npm#publish`, which triggers `meta.json` file update/generation and `.tgz` source code archives creation.

This gives anything you need to respond on a series of requests generated by `npm intall <package_name>` command.

An example of `meta.json` can be found [here](https://registry.npmjs.org/axios)

## How NPM commands work with NPMSlice.

1. Let's say we use `npm publish` in the following way:

```bash
npm publish --registry=http://localhost:8080
```

By invoking such command npm sends following http request:

```json
method: "PUT"
url: "/@hello%2fsimple-npm-project"
headers: { 
  "connection": "keep-alive",
  "user-agent": "npm/6.13.6 node/v10.15.1 darwin x64",
  "npm-in-ci": "false",
  "npm-scope": "@hello",
  "npm-session": "52b4a33613bae565",
  "referer": "publish",
  "content-type": "application/json",
  "accept": "*/*",
  "content-length": "1331",
  "accept-encoding": "gzip,deflate",
  "host": "localhost:8080"
} 
```

With request body which contains `data` field which contains `base64` content of the package. 
Then we generate the meta data and `.tar` package and save it into asto.

2. Let's say now we want to install our package via command:

```bash
npm install --registry=http://localhost:8080  @hello/simple-npm-project
```

First NPM sends following request to get the meta data:

```json
method: "GET"
url: "/@hello%2fsimple-npm-project"
headers: { 
  "connection": "keep-alive",
  "user-agent": "npm/6.13.6 node/v10.15.1 darwin x64",
  "npm-in-ci": "false",
  "npm-scope": "@hello",
  "npm-session": "ee324ef71224a7ee",
  "referer": "install [REDACTED]",
  "pacote-req-type": "packument",
  "pacote-pkg-id": "registry:@hello/simple-npm-project",
  "accept":
   "application/vnd.npm.install-v1+json; q=1.0, application/json; q=0.8, */*",
  "accept-encoding": "gzip,deflate",
  "host": "localhost:8080"
} 
```

and expect following response body with meta info from asto like:

```json
{
  "name": "@hello/simple-npm-project",
  "_id": "@hello/simple-npm-project",
  "readme": "ERROR: No README data found!",
  "time": {
    "created": "2020-03-12T14:51:34.44"
  },
  "users": {},
  "versions": {
    "1.0.1": {
      "name": "@hello/simple-npm-project",
      "version": "1.0.1",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
      },
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC",
      "readme": "ERROR: No README data found!",
      "_id": "@hello/simple-npm-project@1.0.1",
      "_nodeVersion": "10.15.1",
      "_npmVersion": "6.13.6",
      "maintainers": [
        {}
      ],
      "dist": {
        "integrity": "sha512-uTxRHajE8jAoeUMI32YjujfWTxD6D2Ng2hZoeR8jd8Wvx+3cJsda8mh64Cq4pFYvl65Za8OkzLAo2/vU/ibq9A==",
        "shasum": "d20a235fc4fe4f68b02649f349bfeb324178d9b1",
        "tarball": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/@hello/simple-npm-project/-/@hello/simple-npm-project-1.0.1.tgz"
      }
    }
  },
  "_attachments": {},
  "dist-tags": {
    "latest": "1.0.1"
  }
}
```

Then NPM using such meta info sends another request to get a package:

```json
method: "GET"
url: "/@hello/simple-npm-project/-/@hello/simple-npm-project-1.0.1.tgz"
headers: {
  "connection": "keep-alive",
  "user-agent": "npm/6.13.6 node/v10.15.1 darwin x64",
  "npm-in-ci": "false",
  "npm-scope": "@hello",
  "npm-session": "ee324ef71224a7ee",
  "referer": "install [REDACTED]",
  "pacote-req-type": "tarball",
  "pacote-pkg-id": "registry:@hello/simple-npm-project@http://127.0.0.1:8080/@hello/simple-npm-project/-/@hello/simple-npm-project-1.0.1.tgz",
  "accept": "*/*",
  "host": "127.0.0.1:8080" 
}
```

## NPM Proxy

NPM proxy repository could be created using `NpmProxySlice`. 
Proxy repository forwards HTTP requests to specified URL and adapter processes them. 
After receiving artifact from the remote server,
it caches received data and transforms it before sending it back to client 
and saves to local storage. 
Similar request received afterwords will not require remote repository call - 
the cached data will be used.

Detailed explanation about used algorithms and protocols used for proxy implementation
can be found [here](PROXY_IMPLEMENTATION.md). 

## How to contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

To avoid build errors use Maven 3.2+ and please read [contributing rules](https://github.com/artipie/artipie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
