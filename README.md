Artipie is an experimental binary artifact management tool, similar to
[Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/),
[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/product-nexus-repository),
[Archiva](https://archiva.apache.org/),
[ProGet](https://inedo.com/proget),
and many others.
The following set of features makes Artipie unique among all others:

  * It is open source ([MIT license](https://github.com/artipie/artipie/blob/master/LICENSE.txt))
  * It is horizontally scalable, you can add servers easily
  * It is written in reactive Java (using [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/))
  * It supports 10+ package managers, incl.
    [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/),
    [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/),
    [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/),
    [Gem](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/),
    [Go](https://golang.org/),
    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), etc.
  * It is database-free
  * It can host the data in the file system,
    [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),
    [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/),
    [HuaweiCloud OBS](https://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/obs.html) etc.
  * Its quality of Java code is extraordinary high :)

The fastest way to start using Artipie is via
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). First,
create a new directory `artipie` and `repo` sub-directory inside it. Then, put your
YAML config file into the `repo` sub-dir. Make sure that the name of your config file
is the name of repository you are going to host, and its name matches `[a-z0-9_]{3,32}`.
For example `foo.yaml`:

```yaml
repo:
  type: maven
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie
```

Now, go back to `artipie` and start the container:

```bash
$ docker run -v "$(pwd):/var/artipie" -p 8080:80 artipie/artipie
```

You should be able to use it with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
at `http://localhost:8080`.

In the sections below you can see how to configure Artipie
to use it with different package managers.

We recommend you read the "Architecture" section in our
[White Paper](https://github.com/artipie/white-paper) to fully
understand how Artipie is designed.

### Binary Repo

[![](https://github.com/artipie/artipie/workflows/Proof::binary/badge.svg)](./examples/binary)

Try this `repo.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: file
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/data
  permissions:
    "*":
      - "*"
```

You can send HTTP PUT/GET requests
to `http://localhost:8080/repo/<filename>` to upload/download a binary file,
e.g. `http://localhost:8080/repo/libsqlite3.so`.

### Maven Repo

Try this `maven.yaml` file to host a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) repo:

```yaml
repo:
  type: maven
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/maven
  permissions:
    admin:
      - upload
      - download
    jeff:
      - upload
      - download
    "*":
      - download
```

Add [`<distributionManagement>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Distribution_Management)
section to your
[`pom.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)
(don't forget to specify authentication credentials in
[`~/.m2/settings.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Servers)
for `artipie` server):

```xml
<project>
  [...]
  <distributionManagement>
    <snapshotRepository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8080/maven</url>
    </snapshotRepository>
    <repository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <url>http://localhost:8080/maven</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
</project>
```

Then, `mvn deploy` your project.

Add [`<repository>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Repositories) and
[`<pluginRepository>`](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Repositories)
to your `pom.xml` (alternatively
[configure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html)
it via
[`~/.m2/settings.xml`](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html)) to use deployed artifacts:

```xml
<project>
  [...]
  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <name>artipie plugins</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8080/maven</url>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>artipie</id>
      <name>artipie builds</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8080/maven</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
</project>
```

Run `mvn install` (or `mvn install -U` to force download dependencies).

### Maven proxy Repo

Try this `maven-central.yaml` file to host a proxy to Maven central:

```yaml
repo:
  type: maven-proxy
  storage: default
```

Artipie will redirect all Maven requests to Maven central.
Add it [as a mirror](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html)
to `settings.xml`:
```xml
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>artipie-mirror</id>
      <name>Artipie Mirror Repository</name>
      <url>https://central.artipie.com/mirrors/maven-central</url>
      <mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
</settings>
```

### RPM Repo

Create new directory `/var/artipie`, directory for configuration files
`/var/artipie/repo` and directory for RPM repository `/var/artipie/centos`.
Put repository config file to `/var/artipie/repo/centos.yaml`:

```yaml
repo:
  type: rpm
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /var/artipie/centos
  settings:
    digest: sha256 # Digest algorithm for rpm packages checksum calculation, sha256 (default) and sha1 are supported
    naming-policy: sha1 # Naming policy for metadata files: plain, sha1 or sha256 (default) prefixed
    filelists: true # Calculate metadata filelists.xml, true by default
      
```

Put all RPM packages to repository directory: `/var/artipie/centos/centos`.

Optional: generate metadata using [CLI tool](https://github.com/artipie/rpm-adapter/).

Start Artipie Docker image:

```bash
$ docker run -v /var/artipie:/var/artipie artipie/artipie
```

On the client machine add local repository to the list of repos:

 - Install `yum-utils` if needed: `yum install yum-utils`
 - Add repository: `yum-config-manager --add-repo=http://yourepo/`
 - Refresh the repo: `yum upgrade all`
 - Download packages: `yum install package-name`

### NPM Repo

Try this `npm.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: npm
  path: /npm
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/npm
  permissions:
    john:
      - download
      - upload
    jane:
      - upload
```

To publish your npm project use the following command:

```bash
$ npm publish --registry=http://localhost:8080/npm
```

### NPM Proxy Repo

Try this `npm-proxy.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: npm-proxy
  path: npm-proxy
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/npm-proxy
  settings:
    remote:
      url: https://registry.npmjs.org
```

To use it for downloading packages use the following command:

```bash
$ npm install --registry=http://localhost:8080/npm-proxy <package name>
```

or set it as a default repository:

```bash
$ npm set registry http://localhost:8080/npm-proxy
```

### Go Repo

Try this `go.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: go
  path: go
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/go
  permissions:
    admin:
      - "*"
    "*":
      - download
```

To use it for installing packages add it to `GOPROXY` environment variable:

```bash
$ export GOPROXY="http://localhost:8080/go,https://proxy.golang.org,direct"
```

Go packages have to be located in the local repository by their
names and versions, contain Go module and dependencies information
in `.mod` and `.info` files. Here is an example for package
`example.com/foo/bar` versions `0.0.1` and `0.0.2`:

```
/example.com
  /foo
    /bar
      /@v
        list
        v0.0.1.zip
        v0.0.1.mod
        v0.0.1.info
        v0.0.2.zip
        v0.0.2.mod
        v0.0.2.info
```

`list` is simple text file with list of the available versions.
You can use [go-adapter](https://github.com/artipie/go-adapter#how-it-works)
to generate necessary files and layout for Go source code.

### PHP Composer Repo

Try this `my-php.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: php
  path: my-php
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-php
```

To publish your PHP Composer package create package description JSON file `my-package.json`
with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "my-org/my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dist": {
    "url": "https://www.my-org.com/files/my-package.1.0.0.zip",
    "type": "zip"
  }
}
```

And add it to repository using PUT request:

```bash
$ curl -X PUT -T 'my-package.json' "http://localhost:8080/my-php"
```

To use this library in your project add requirement and repository to `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
         {"type": "composer", "url": "http://localhost:8080/my-php"}
    ],
    "require": {
        "my-org/my-package": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

### NuGet Repo

Try this `nuget.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: nuget
  path: my-nuget
  url: http://localhost:8080/my-nuget
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-nuget
```

To publish your NuGet package use the following command:

```bash
$ nuget push my.lib.1.0.0.nupkg -Source=http://localhost:8080/my-nuget/index.json
```

To install the package into a project use the following command:

```bash
$ nuget install MyLib -Version 1.0.0 -Source=http://localhost:8080/my-nuget/index.json
```

### Gem Repo

Try this `gem.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: gem
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-nuget
```

Publish a gem:

```bash
$ gem push my_first_gem-0.0.0.gem --host http://localhost:8080/gem
```

Install a gem:

```bash
$ gem install my_first_gem --source http://localhost:8080/gem
```

### Helm chart repo

Try this `helm.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: helm
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/helm-charts
```

Publish a chart:

```bash
$ curl --data-binary "@my_chart-1.6.4.tgz" http://localhost:8080/helm
```

Install a chart:

```bash
$ helm repo add artipie http://localhost:8080/helm/charts
$ helm install my_chart artipie
```

### Docker Repo

Try this `docker.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: docker
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-docker
```

Docker registry has to be protected by HTTPS and should have no prefix in path.
In order to access this Docker repository it is required to run a reverse proxy such as
[nginx](https://nginx.org/) or [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) to protect Artipie
with HTTPS and add forwarding of requests from `my-docker.my-company.com/<path>` to
`my-artipie.my-company.com/my-docker/<path>`.
Then to push your Docker image use the following command:

```bash
$ docker push my-docker.my-company.com/my-image
```

To pull the image use the following command:

```bash
$ docker pull my-docker.my-company.com/my-image
```

### Docker Proxy Repo

Try this `docker-proxy.yaml` file to host a proxy to `mcr.microsoft.com` registry:

```yaml
repo:
  type: docker-proxy
  settings:
    host: mcr.microsoft.com
```

Artipie will redirect all pull requests to specified registry.

Proxy repository supports caching in local storage.
To enable it and make previously accessed images available when source repository is down 
add `storage` section to config:

```yaml
repo:
  type: docker-proxy
  settings:
    host: mcr.microsoft.com
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-docker-cache
```

### Python repo

Try this `pypi.yaml` file:

```yaml
repo:
  type: pypi
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/python-repo
```

Publish a package(whl or tar.gz):
  * Install twine utility, if you don't do it already [docs](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives).
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
```
  * build the package, as described in python docs
  * upload to server with a command
```bash
$ python3 -m twine upload --repository-url http://localhost:8080/pypi/ -u user.name -p pass testpkg/dist/*
```

Install a package:

```bash
$ pip install --index-url http://localhost:8080/pypi/ testpkg
```

## Additional configuration

Environment variables:
 - `SSL_TRUSTALL` - trust all unkown certificates

## Multitenancy

You may want to run Artipie for your company, which has a few teams.
Each team may want to have its own repository. To do this, you create
a global configuration file `/etc/artipie.yml`:

```yaml
meta:
  layout: org
  storage:
    type: fs
    path: /tmp/artipie/data/my-docker
  credentials:
    type: file
    path: _credentials.yml
```

If the `type` is set to `file`, another YAML file is required in the storage, with
a list of users who will be allowed to create repos
(each `pass` is combination or either `plain` or `sha256` and a text):


```yaml
credentials:
  jane:
    pass: "plain:qwerty"
  john:
    pass: "sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

If the `type` is set to `env`, the following environment variables are expected:
`ARTIPIE_USER_NAME` and `ARTIPIE_USER_PASS`. For example, you start
Docker container with the `-e` option:

```bash
docker run -d -v /var/artipie:/var/artipie` -p 80:80 \
  -e ARTIPIE_USER_NAME=artipie -e ARTIPIE_USER_PASS=qwerty \
  artipie/artipie:latest
```

## Metrics

You may enable some basic metrics collecting and periodic publishing to application log
by adding `metrics` to `meta` section of global configuration file `/etc/artipie.yml`:

```yaml
meta:
  metrics:
    type: log
```

## How to contribute

Fork the repository, make changes, and send us a
[pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html). We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

To avoid build errors use Maven 3.2+.

## How to run it locally

To run Artipie server locally, build it with `mvn clean package -Passembly`
and run with *(change port if needed)*:
```java
java -jar target/artipie-jar-with-dependencies.jar --config=example/artipie.yaml --port=8080
```
Example configuration uses `org` layout of Artipie with two level hierarchy,
user `test` with password `123`, and `default` storage in `./example/storage` direcotry.
To access the dashboard open `http://localhost:8080/test` in your browser and enter user credentials.
